## setTimeout function for React

> I was able to implement the setTimeout function in Vanilla JS when I first completed rock paper scissors during the first semester. 
- Here is an example of how to complete it for React

```js
 setTimeout(() => {
      setPlayerChoice(null);
      setComputerChoice(null);
      setWinner('')
      }, 2000)
```
> This worked very well for my rock paper scissors app for my React project!
