## Epic Hyperspace

I decided to expand my technical skills due to my healthcare background. Currently, I am a nurse at a family medicine clinic. I am utilizing EPIC hyperspace at work (ambulatory) for the outpatient clinics. Therefore, the training I am completing relates to outpatient work for both providers and nurses. 

At work, I am planning to keep in close contact with the Epic Champion on the team and will attend the bi-weekly EPIC meetings to keep myself up to date with the new changes coming from EPIC. 

I plan to still continue to code, but wanted to spend 3-4 weeks diving into this to pass the proficiency test, to have an additional set of skills under my belt. This is different than what I have doing post-turing, but I know this will help me in the long run at work and open the doors to new opportunities in healthcare.
