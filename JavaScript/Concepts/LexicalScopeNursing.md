## Lexical Scope vs Nursing

> Lexical scoping is similar to how patient information is managed and accessed in a hospital setting! I imagine the hospital as a large program! The hospital has different departments, like how I was on the neuro trama and ortho trauma unit. 

- The global scope would be the entire hospital. At my hopsital, there were certain policies or protocols are global and apply throughout the hospital. An example in programming is a globally scoped variable that is accessible from anywhere in the code.
- The ward would be the function scope, which is the neuro trauma unit. Each ward has it's own medications that are actually not accessible to other wards unless it is explicitly transferred, in programming, the variables are defined within a function that are only accessible within that function or by functions that are defined within the same function. 
- The block scope are specific rooms within the ward. Inside of each ward, there are speciifc rooms that need special medications or equipment that are not found in other wards. For programming, this is similar to variables being only accessible within that block (curly braces).

> As a nurse, I adhere to specific protocols about where and how medications are accessed and administered. Similar to programming, we use lexical scoping rules to manage where variables can be accessed and modified. Both of these systems are designed to prevent errors and ensure that the actions or variables are managed safely and are predictable in the right context.
