## Functional Programing
< Function oriented design is the result of focusing attention to the function of the program.
- emphasizes on the use of functions where each function performs a specific task
- Fundamental elements used are variables and functions.The data in the functions are immutable(cannot be changed after creation)
- Importance is not given to data but to functions.
- It is a top down approach.

## Object Oriented Programing
< Object oriented design is the result of focusing attention not on the function performed by the program, but instead on the data that are to be manipulated by the program. 
- paradigm is based on object oriented concept. Classes are used where instance of objects are created
- Fundamental elements used are objects and methods and the data used here are mutable data.
- Importance is given to data rather than procedures.
- It is a bottom up approach.
