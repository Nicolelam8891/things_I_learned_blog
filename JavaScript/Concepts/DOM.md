## What is the DOM? 

> It is known as the document object model
- Programming interface provided by web browsers that allow scripts to dynamically access and update the content and style, of a website 

1. DOM: collection of objects with properties and methods
- contains parents, child nodes and siblings

<html> is the root
<head> these are the branches
<body> these are the brances
<h1> these are the leaves
<p1> these are the leaves

- Child nodes have a parent. Ex: child nodes are <head>, <body>, <p>
- Sibling nodes are nodes that are placed next to another node in the tree
Ex: <p> node can be a sibling of a heading <h1> node

The DOM is made of nodes

> Important: React is a JS library for building user interfaces through the creation and management of components. Each React component corresponds ot a part of the DOM. We write html using JSX JS syntax extention. This allows HTML to be mixed with Javascript. React then uses the JSX and uses it to render components as elements in the DOM.
