# things_I_learned_blog

 ##   Welcome to my blog about things I have learned!

In 2023, I took a bold step. I enrolled in a coding class at the Turing School of Software and Design after one of my nursing shifts. I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and to prepare for the interview process, I studied LSAT questions. My efforts paid off, and I was accepted into the program. I started the Front-End Software Engineering program on July 3rd, 2023. This intensive, accredited bootcamp spanned over 1500 hours, lasting seven months. Graduating recently, I've come to realize the extent of my personal growth and newfound resilience.

During the program, I dedicated 80 hours a week, all while balancing the responsibilities of caring for a one-year-old and maintaining my nursing license. This journey was exceptionally challenging because I had never coded before! After spending over a decade in healthcare, transitioning into the world of software development was a HUGE change. You might wonder why I decided to pivot away from a career I had worked so hard to build over the years. My decision was ignited by a newfound passion for creation and creativity!

With my background as a nurse with experience in both hospital and clinical settings, I have witnessed firsthand how technology has played a pivotal role in preventing medical errors, enhancing nursing efficiency, and helping patients manage their health through various applications. The transformative impact of technology on healthcare has left a lasting impression on me.

This shift in perspective inspired me to change careers and immerse myself fully in the world of technology. My goal is to build apps that genuinely assist individuals from all walks of life, creating applications that hold meaningful value and make a real difference. I strive to create good user interface with good user flow!

One of my proudest achievements was my contribution to the Ears, Nose, and Throat clinic, where I created multiple educational handouts to benefit the patients and improve the clinic's workflow. This achievement holds a special place in my heart as it demonstrates the positive impact I can have on both the clinic and the patients I serve.

As a front-end software developer, my ambition is to create purposeful and meaningful apps that cater to individuals from diverse backgrounds. I aspire to build applications that are user-friendly, contribute positively to the community, and focus on user empathy. I am not creating tools for myself, but for everyone...which is why I find the importance of walking in my user's shoes and fully understanding their perspective, needs, or even fears.

I am currently in the process of job hunting for my first role in software development. I am learning so much, which is why I decided to keep a blog of everything I am learning thus far! 

Thanks for swinging by and checking out my little blog of learning.
