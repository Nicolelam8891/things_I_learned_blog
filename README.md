 ##   ðŸ“š What I have learned! ðŸ“‘ 

On July 2023, I began my journey at Turing School of Software & Design. I dedicated 80+ hours a week, all while balancing the responsibilities of caring for a one-year-old and maintaining my Nursing license. This journey was exceptionally challenging because I had never coded before! After spending over a decade in healthcare, transitioning into the world of software development was a HUGE change...but I was ignited by a newfound passion for creation and creativity in technology! ðŸ’»

With my background as a nurse ðŸ’‰ðŸ’Š, I have witnessed firsthand how technology has played a pivotal role in preventing medical errors, enhancing nursing efficiency, and helping patients manage their health through various applications. ðŸ˜Œ This shift in perspective inspired me to change careers and immerse myself fully in the world of technology. My goal is to build apps that genuinely assist individuals from all walks of life, creating applications that hold meaningful value and make a real difference. I strive to create good user interface with good user flow! I aspire to build applications that are user-friendly and focus on user empathy. I find the importance of walking in my user's shoes and fully understanding their perspective, needs, or even fears.
